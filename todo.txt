Today:
- Make a component to display Sale object and find a way to not hardcode its attrs
- Make HeaderItem component
- Rework project layout for best practices
- Work on Anki addon


Overall:
- Groupby
- Charts
- Modal ?
- Results by field
- Alerts
- Report list
- Detail page
- Report list
- Report detail
- PDFs
- Dropzone + favicon
- My profile
- Protecting views?
- Navbar?
- Sale detail page
--> After this add my own stuff that I want(mostly about data analysis and visualization)


Bugs/Fixes:
- Rework SaleDetailPage without hardcoding and make an adequate component to display sale info
- Fix sales not updating on login
- Fix search to search by different params
- Rework check for logged in users(getItem(access_token) isnt safe, window.reload() isnt good too)


# Notes:
1. Get ideas from the kaggle code section for data visualization
